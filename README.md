How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs requires following best practices such as modular design, clear documentation, and structured code organization. In this project, the CRUD Python module from Project One was designed with object-oriented principles, making it reusable and easy to integrate into the dashboard in Project Two. This approach allowed for a clear separation of concerns, where database operations were handled separately from the user interface. The advantages of this approach included code reusability, ease of debugging, and simplified future modifications. The CRUD module could be extended for other applications that require database interactions, such as animal tracking, adoption management, or other search-and-rescue operations.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When solving problems as a computer scientist, it is essential to break down complex tasks into manageable components. For this project, the database and dashboard requirements provided by Grazioso Salvare were addressed by first analyzing the data structure in MongoDB and then defining the filtering and visualization needs. Unlike previous assignments that focused more on theoretical aspects of database operations, this project required an applied approach where real-time updates and interactivity were essential. Techniques such as aggregation pipelines for data processing and optimized indexing for faster queries were used to enhance efficiency. Future database projects would benefit from a similar approachâ€”starting with clear requirements analysis, implementing modular code, and optimizing performance through data indexing and query refinement.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing, implementing, and optimizing software systems. In this project, the work done directly impacted Grazioso Salvare's ability to identify and categorize rescue dogs efficiently, improving their workflow. By developing an interactive dashboard that integrates database queries with a real-time visualization layer, the project demonstrated how data-driven decision-making can enhance an organization's operations. The ability to filter dogs based on rescue type, analyze breed distributions, and view real-time locations ensures that Grazioso Salvare can quickly identify suitable candidates for training. This project showcases how computer science solutions drive efficiency, automate processes, and provide insights from data to support mission-critical operations.
